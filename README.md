# DisplaySizeMatters

It can be hard to judge how big a TV or PC monitor you should get or how big the difference between two sizes actually is.
Display Size Matters lets you visually compare televisions of different sizes and aspect ratios.

Experts recommend that your television takes up about 30 degrees of your field of vision.
Move the TV around to find your ideal viewing distance.

Widescreen monitors are now omnipresent, with the 16:9 aspect ratio being the current mainstream standard.
Compare it with the ultrawide 21:9 monitors or with the even wider 38:9 display.

Use Meta passthrough technology see the selected TV in your own (real) living room.
